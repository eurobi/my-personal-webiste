                      <td class="table-desc">I've been working on Influencer Marketing at Current for 2 years.  In that time I've worked with hundreds of influencers on thousands of campaigns, garnering <strong>billions</strong> of views. I was featured in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/top-influencer-marketers-at-brands-list-dunkin-chipotle-seatgeek-2021-1">Business Insider's top Influencer Marketers</a> and our work earned us a <a href="https://shortyawards.com/14th/current-1">Shorty Award for YouTube presence by a brand</a>.</td>

                      <td class="table-desc">I spent 4 years at SeatGeek doing influencer marketing, building the program from a few small infleuncer deals per month, to hundreds of deals per month. We were nominated for a <a href="https://www.streamys.org/nominees-winners/9th-annual-nominees/">Streamy Award</a> for our work. A sneak peak of what that work looks like can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbuqdf8Fgas">here</a>. I also built the Brand Ambassador program from the ground up (before I knew how to actually code) by piecing together software like Airtable and Zapier.  On top of this I managed our Audio marketing, where we worked with hundreds of Podcasts.</td>
